# MineSweeper
 This project is made by STM32f746g_DISCOVERY
## Main file
>"main.c" is still needed, but most of the code is not write there, we will write it down in "STenWin/APP/*DLG.c".
<br>The main reason is that we have some pages which we want to change each other.
<br>This project needs two pages to represent its function, so we have two file named "*DLG.c".
